  abstract = {Abstract Purpose of Review The concern of mercury pollution and the impact that it poses on the marine environment were studied heavily since the case of the poison from Minamata bay in the 1960s. The present study provides an insight into the cycle of mercury and methylmercury in the marine environment and the bioindicators that reflect the exposure levels. The paper also used the driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) analysis to evaluate the global mercury and methylmercury contamination problem. Recent Findings The high global budgets of atmospheric total mercury influence the ocean surface water. Therefore, the aquatic environment contamination level is in turn affected by the surrounding emission sources such as industrial and petroleum activities in addition to the transport and fate of mercury across the environmental compartments. This will increase the mercury levels in fish species and will cause an adverse risk to human health through biomagnification. Summary This review presents a thorough description of mercury sources and emissions and their fate and transport across the different environmental compartments, despite the fact that serious mitigation measures were taken and guidelines were applied. The risk from fish consumption is still a serious concern as a result of the current mercury emissions and stability and persistent characteristics.},

The ANCOVA estimator of the treatment effect is consistent under arbitrary model misspecification. In an article recently published in the journal, Wang et al proved the model-based variance estimator for the treatment effect is also consistent under outcome model misspecification, assuming the probability of randomization to each treatment is 1/2. In this reader reaction, we derive explicit expressions which show that when randomization is unequal, the model-based variance estimator can be biased upwards or downwards. In contrast, robust sandwich variance estimators can provide asymptotically valid inferences under arbitrary misspecification, even when randomization probabilities are not equal.},

Toxaphene causes minor restrictions. At present it is not clear that if PCBs and dioxins/furans were to decrease below their fish consumption advisory guidelines, current fish mercury levels would replace some, most or all of the consumption restrictions. In order to examine this, location-, species- and size-specific fish consumption advisories were calculated for a ``mercury only'' scenario by disregarding the presence of the other contaminants. In the absence of other contaminants, mercury would replace some of the current advisories caused by other contaminants; however, the overall advisories would be minimally to moderately restrictive ({$<$}1\textendash 7\% for GP; 13\textendash 32\% for SP). Almost half of the Great Lake blocks considered here would have more than double the unrestricted consumption advisories than they currently have, with Lake Ontario showing the greatest improvement. Certain size ranges of each species across the main basins of the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes would be deemed safe for unrestricted consumption. However, at least some sizes of a number of species from certain locations of each lake would still have ``do not eat'' advisories issued for the SP, although these restrictions would be minimal for Lake Erie. These results suggest that the current mercury levels in the Canadian Great Lakes fish are of very minor concern for the GP and of moderate concern for the SP.},

Mercury (Hg) monitoring programs are valuable for generating data that can be compiled for spatially broad syntheses to identify emergent ecosystem properties that influence fish Hg bioaccumulation. Fish total Hg (THg) concentrations were evaluated across the Western United States (US) and Canada, a region defined by extreme gradients in habitat structure and water management. A database was compiled with THg concentrations in 96,310 fish that comprised 206 species from 4262 locations, and used to evaluate the spatial distribution of fish THg across the region and effects of species, foraging guilds, habitats, and ecoregions. Areas of elevated THg exposure were identified by developing a relativized estimate of fish mercury concentrations at a watershed scale that accounted for the variability associated with fish species, fish size, and site effects. THg concentrations in fish muscle ranged between 0.001 and 28.4 ({$\mu$}g/g wet weight (ww)) with a geometric mean of 0.17. Overall, 30\% of individual fish samples and 17\% of means by location exceeded the 0.30{$\mu$}g/g ww US EPA fish tissue criterion. Fish THg concentrations differed among habitat types, with riverine habitats consistently higher than lacustrine habitats. Importantly, fish THg concentrations were not correlated with sediment THg concentrations at a watershed scale, but were weakly correlated with sediment MeHg concentrations, suggesting that factors influencing MeHg production may be more important than inorganic Hg loading for determining fish MeHg exposure. There was large heterogeneity in fish THg concentrations across the landscape; THg concentrations were generally higher in semi-arid and arid regions such as the Great Basin and Desert Southwest, than in temperate forests. Results suggest that fish mercury exposure is widespread throughout Western US and Canada, and that species, habitat type, and region play an important role in influencing ecological risk of mercury in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems downstream of mercury (Hg) contaminated sites can be impacted by both localized releases as well as Hg deposited to the watershed from atmospheric transport. Identifying the source of Hg in water, sediment, and fish downstream of contaminated sites is important for determining the effectiveness of source-control remediation actions. This study uses measurements of Hg stable isotopes in soil, sediment, water, and fish to differentiate between Hg from an abandoned Hg mine from non-mine-related sources. The study site is located within the Willamette River watershed (Oregon, United States), which includes free-flowing river segments and a reservoir downstream of the mine. The concentrations of total-Hg (THg) in the reservoir fish were 4-fold higher than those further downstream ({$>$}90 km) from the mine site in free-flowing sections of the river. Mercury stable isotope fractionation analysis showed that the mine tailings ({$\delta$}202Hg: -0.36\textperthousand{} {$\pm$} 0.03\textperthousand ) had a distinctive isotopic composition compared to background soils ({$\delta$}202Hg: -2.30\textperthousand{} {$\pm$} 0.25\textperthousand ). Similar differences in isotopic composition were observed between stream water that flowed through the tailings (particulate bound {$\delta$}202Hg: -0.58\textperthousand; dissolved: -0.91\textperthousand ) versus a background stream (particle-bound {$\delta$}202Hg: -2.36\textperthousand; dissolved: -2.09\textperthousand ). Within the reservoir sediment, the Hg isotopic composition indicated that the proportion of the Hg related to mine-release increased with THg concentrations. However, in the fish samples the opposite trend was observed\textemdash the degree of mine-related Hg was lower in fish with the higher THg concentrations. While sediment concentrations clearly show the influence of the mine, the relationship in fish is more complicated due to differences in methylmercury (MeHg) formation and the foraging behavior of different fish species. The fish tissue {$\delta$}13C and {$\Delta$}199Hg values indicate that there is a higher influence of mine-sourced Hg in fish feeding in a more sediment-based food web and less so in planktonic and littoral-based food webs. Identifying the relative proportion of Hg from local contaminated site can help inform remediation decisions, especially when the relationship between total Hg concentrations and sources do not show similar covariation between abiotic and biotic media.},

For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data.},

Mercury biomagnification per \%\textperthousand{} {$\delta$}15N varied from 22 to 29\% in the three groups of lakes. Mercury availability to organisms at the base of the food chain in lakes with cut catchments was higher than that in reference lakes. In cut lakes, Hg concentrations in fish were significantly related to ratio of the clear-cut area to lake area (or lake volume; r = +0.82 and +0.74, respectively, p {$<$} 0.01). Both impact ratios were, in turn, significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon. These findings suggest that differential loading of organic matter\textendash bound Hg to lakes can affect Hg cycling. In addition, Hg concentrations exceeded the advisory limit for human consumption (0.5 {$\mu$}g/g wet wt) from the World Health Organization in all top predatory species (northern pike, walleye, and burbot) found in cut and in two partially burnt lakes. Thus, high Hg concentrations in fish from forest-harvested and partially burnt lakes may reflect increased exposure to Hg relative to that in lakes not having these watershed disturbances.},

The ``rate'' of mercury biomagnification is being assessed more frequently using stable nitrogen isotope ratios ({$\delta$}15N), a measure of relative trophic position of biota within a food web. Within food webs and across diverse systems, log-transformed Hg concentrations are significantly and positively related to {$\delta$}15N and the slopes of these models vary from one study to another for reasons that are not yet understood. Here we compared the rates of Hg biomagnification in 14 lake trout lakes from three provinces in Canada to understand whether any characteristics of the ecosystems explained this among-system variability. Several fish species, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates were collected from these lakes and analyzed for total Hg (fish only), methyl Hg (invertebrates) and stable isotopes ({$\delta$}15N; {$\delta$}13C to assess energy sources). Mercury biomagnification rates varied significantly across systems and were higher for food webs of larger (surface area), higher nutrient lakes. However, the slopes were not predictive of among-lake differences in Hg in the lake trout. Results indicate that among-system differences in the rates of Hg biomagnification seen in the literature may be due, in part, to differences in ecosystem characteristics although the mechanisms for this variability are not yet understood.},

Our goal was to investigate the ecological and environmental influences over concentrations of As, Cr, and other elements in these fish to better understand what affects metal uptake and the risk to consumers. We measured 10 elements (including As, Cr, Hg) as well as carbon ({$\delta$}13C), nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N), and sulfur ({$\delta$}34S) stable isotopes in 388 fish from 25 lake and river sites across this remote region. These data were used to determine the effect of: 1) trophic ecology; and 2) watershed geology on piscine elemental content. Overall, most element concentrations were low, often below provincial advisory benchmarks (ABs). However, traces of Hg, As, Cr, and selenium (Se) were detected in most fish. Based on their exceedance of their respective ABs, the most restrictive elements on fish consumption in these boreal systems were Hg{$>$}As{$>$}Cr. Arsenic and Se, but not Cr concentrations were related to fish size and trophic ecology (inferred from {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N), suggesting bioaccumulation of the former elements. Fish with enriched {$\delta$}34S values, suggestive of anadromous behaviour, had lower Hg and higher Se concentrations. Modeling results suggested a strong effect of site-specific factors, though we found weak trends between piscine elemental content and geological features (e.g., mafic intrusions), potentially due to the broad spatial scale of this study. Results from this study address gaps in our understanding of As and Cr bioaccumulation and will be help inform fish consumption guidelines.},

The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach proposed by Rue, Martino, and Chopin (2009) is a computationally effective alternative to MCMC for Bayesian inference. INLA is designed for latent Gaussian models, a very wide and flexible class of models ranging from (generalized) linear mixed to spatial and spatio-temporal models. Combined with the stochastic partial differential equation approach (SPDE, Lindgren, Rue, and Lindstrom 2011), one can accommodate all kinds of geographically referenced data, including areal and geostatistical ones, as well as spatial point process data. The implementation interface covers stationary spatial models, non-stationary spatial models, and also spatio-temporal models, and is applicable in epidemiology, ecology, environmental risk assessment, as well as general geostatistics.},

  abstract = {Forest management can alter the mobilization of mercury (Hg) into headwater streams and its conversion to methylmercury (MeHg), the form that bioaccumulates in and biomagnifies through food webs. As headwater streams are important sources of organic materials and nutrients to larger systems, this connectivity may also increase MeHg in downstream biota through direct or indirect effects of forestry on water quality or food web structure. In this study, we collected water, seston, food sources (biofilm, leaves, organic matter), five macroinvertebrate taxa and fish (slimy sculpin; Cottus cognata ) at 6 sites representing different stream orders (1\textendash 5) within three river basins with different total disturbances from forestry (both harvesting and silviculture). Methylmercury levels were highest in water and some food sources from the basin with moderate disturbance (greater clearcutting but less silviculture). Water, leaves, stoneflies and fish increased in MeHg or total Hg along the river continuum in the least disturbed basin, and there were some dissipative effects of forest management on these spatial patterns. Trophic level ({$\delta$} 15 N) was a significant predictor of MeHg (and total Hg in fish) within food webs across all 18 sites, and biomagnification slopes were significantly lower in the basin with moderate total disturbance but not different in the other two basins. The elevated MeHg in lower trophic levels but its reduced trophic transfer in the basin with moderate disturbance was likely due to greater inputs of sediments and of dissolved organic carbon that is more humic, as these factors are known to both increase transport of Hg to streams and its uptake in primary producers but to also decrease MeHg bioaccumulation in consumers. Overall, these results suggest that the type of disturbance from forestry affects MeHg bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in stream food webs and some longitudinal patterns along a river continuum. \textbullet{} Forestry increases methylmercury (MeHg) in small streams but impacts along the river continuum are unclear. \textbullet{} Elevated MeHg in basal compartments at upstream through downstream sites linked to greater \% clearcutting in one basin. \textbullet{} This elevated basal MeHg did not increase fish Hg due to lower trophic transfer in this basin. \textbullet{} MeHg in some compartments increased longitudinally in the basin with low forestry disturbance. \textbullet{} Little evidence of forestry impacts on biomagnification efficiency along river continuum.},

In the present study, bioaccumulation and depuration patterns of inorganic Hg(II) and methylmercury (MeHg) in a herbivorous rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus were investigated at organ and subcellular levels following waterborne or dietary exposures. The results showed that the efflux rate constants of Hg(II) and MeHg were 0.104d(-1) and 0.024d(-1) , respectively, and are probably the highest rate constants recorded in fish thus far. The dietary MeHg assimilation efficiency (68\%) was much lower than those in other fish species ({$\sim$}90\%). The predominant distribution of MeHg in fish muscle was attributable to negligible elimination of MeHg from muscle ({$<$}0) and efficient elimination of MeHg from gills (0.12d(-1) ), liver (0.17d(-1) ), and intestine (0.20d(-1) ), as well as efficient transportation of MeHg from other organs into muscle. In contrast, Hg(II) was much more slowly distributed into muscle but was efficiently eliminated by the intestine (0.13d(-1) ). Subcellular distribution indicated that some specific membrane proteins in muscle were the primary binding pools for MeHg, and both metallothionein-like proteins and Hg-rich granules were the important components in eliminating both MeHg and Hg(II). Overall, the present study's results suggest that the low tissue Hg concentration in the rabbitfish was partly explained by its unique biokinetics.

  abstract = {Consumption of fish has well-known human health benefits, though some fish may contain elevated levels of mercury (Hg) that are especially harmful to developing children. Fish length is most often the basis for establishing fishery harvest regulations that determine which fish will ultimately be consumed by humans. It is, therefore, essential to quantify the relationship between fish length and Hg accumulation in regard to harvest regulations for effective fishery and public health policy. We examined this relationship for three sportfish from six lakes across North Carolina, USA. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) had the lowest Hg levels and only the very largest fish in the most contaminated site exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Hg screening level. Black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) had an intermediate level of Hg and larger individuals exceeded the USEPA screening level; however, they tended not to exceed this level before reaching the harvest length limit. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) exceeded the USEPA screening level at sizes below the fishery length limit in two lakes, leaving only higher risk fish for anglers to harvest and consume. Removing the effects of fish age and trophic position, we found strong positive correlations between Hg and fish length for largemouth bass and black crappie. We suggest public health officials and wildlife managers collaborate to structure fishery regulations and length-based fish consumption advisories that protect consumers from Hg exposure and communicate the relative risk of fish consumption.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine if natural fires and logging have a significant impact on abundance, growth, and size structure of fish populations in 38 lakes of the Laurentian Shield (Qu\'ebec, Canada). The watersheds of nine of these lakes underwent logging and nine underwent natural fires, while the 20 remaining lakes were used as references. No significant differences were found among the three lake groups in the catch per unit of effort of the most abundant species: white sucker (Catostomus commersoni), northern pike (Esox lucius), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), fallfish (Semotilus corporalis), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), and burbot (Lota lota). No significant difference was found among control, burned, and logged lakes in the back-calculated length of yellow perch, for which age determinations were made. However, we found that the proportions of small yellow perch and white sucker were significantly lower in populations of impacted lakes (burned and logged lakes pooled). The influence of logging and fires remained significant when a series of biotic and abiotic variables on watershed and lake characteristics were accounted for in multiple regression analyses. The lower proportion of small fish in impacted lakes could be due to an increase in postemergence mortality or to a shift of individuals to the pelagic zone.},

We investigated current patterns in fish Hg across a climatic gradient in northern Ontario, Canada, to assess the possible influence of further climate change. Cohabiting populations of walleye (a piscivore) and white sucker (a benthivore) were sampled from lakes spanning over 9.0\textdegree{} of latitude (45\textdegree{} 24{${'}$} N\textendash 54\textdegree{} 20{${'}$} N). Latitudinal trends were evident in climatic conditions, as well as several other ecosystem characteristics over this range. Muscle total Hg concentration ([THg]) was modelled with respect to climatic variables as well as other physical, chemical, and biological variables, and all models were ranked by Akaike information criterion. Neither long-term mean temperature nor precipitation was a strong predictor of current muscle [THg] in either species across this region. Instead, drainage basin characteristics (for example, mean slope) and lake water chemistry (for example, [DOC], [SO4]) were the strongest predictors, followed by fish biological traits (for example, muscle {$\delta$}13C). Walleye [THg] was more strongly related to water chemistry, and white sucker [THg] was more strongly related to drainage basin physical characteristics. For both species, muscle [THg] showed unimodal relationships with several predictors (for example, latitude, [SO4], [DOC]), peaking in their mid-ranges. Fish [THg] is not strongly associated with current climatic conditions across northern Ontario but may be influenced by climate change in future through indirect effects on water chemistry and food web structure.},

However, mercury concentrations vary among waterbodies and fishes due to a suite of environmental conditions and detection of elevated mercury concentrations is imperfect, resulting in inaccurate consumption guidelines. Occupancy models may be a useful approach for addressing these issues but have not been used for these purposes. Our objectives were to use occupancy modeling to (1) estimate number of samples needed to detect mercury levels surpassing {$>$}0.30mg/kg wet weight in fish at a waterbody (2) identify individual fish-level factors associated with detection probability, and (3) identify environmental-level factors linked to elevated mercury levels in fish at a waterbody. Mercury concentrations were estimated from {$>$}500 largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and walleye Sander vitreus from 30 waterbodies throughout Iowa, USA to identify individuals with concentrations {$>$} or  0.30mg/kg varied between species and increased with fish length; consequently, more samples were needed to detect elevated mercury concentrations in small versus large fish. The probability of a waterbody having fish with elevated mercury levels increased with the percent grassland and declined with percent agriculture in the watershed, providing prioritization metrics for mercury surveillance programs. Our results demonstrate that occupancy models can be a valuable tool for mercury surveillance due to their ability to estimate necessary sample sizes and identify fish sizes and waterbodies with elevated mercury concentrations while accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.},
