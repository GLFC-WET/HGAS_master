  abstract = {Abstract Purpose of Review The concern of mercury pollution and the impact that it poses on the marine environment were studied heavily since the case of the poison from Minamata bay in the 1960s. The present study provides an insight into the cycle of mercury and methylmercury in the marine environment and the bioindicators that reflect the exposure levels. The paper also used the driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) analysis to evaluate the global mercury and methylmercury contamination problem. Recent Findings The high global budgets of atmospheric total mercury influence the ocean surface water. Therefore, the aquatic environment contamination level is in turn affected by the surrounding emission sources such as industrial and petroleum activities in addition to the transport and fate of mercury across the environmental compartments. This will increase the mercury levels in fish species and will cause an adverse risk to human health through biomagnification. Summary This review presents a thorough description of mercury sources and emissions and their fate and transport across the different environmental compartments, despite the fact that serious mitigation measures were taken and guidelines were applied. The risk from fish consumption is still a serious concern as a result of the current mercury emissions and stability and persistent characteristics.},

  abstract = {Forest soils harbor hyper-diverse microbial communities which fundamentally regulate carbon and nutrient cycling across the globe. Directly testing hypotheses on how microbiome diversity is linked to forest carbon storage has been difficult, due to a lack of paired data on microbiome diversity and in situ observations of forest carbon accumulation and storage. Here, we investigated the relationship between soil microbiomes and forest carbon across 238 forest inventory plots spanning 15 European countries. We show that the composition and diversity of fungal, but not bacterial, species is tightly coupled to both forest biotic conditions and a seven-fold variation in tree growth rates and biomass carbon stocks when controlling for the effects of dominant tree type, climate, and other environmental factors. This linkage is particularly strong for symbiotic endophytic and ectomycorrhizal fungi known to directly facilitate tree growth. Since tree growth rates in this system are closely and positively correlated with belowground soil carbon stocks, we conclude that fungal composition is a strong predictor of overall forest carbon storage across the European continent.},

In an article recently published in the journal, Wang et al proved the model-based variance estimator for the treatment effect is also consistent under outcome model misspecification, assuming the probability of randomization to each treatment is 1/2. In this reader reaction, we derive explicit expressions which show that when randomization is unequal, the model-based variance estimator can be biased upwards or downwards. In contrast, robust sandwich variance estimators can provide asymptotically valid inferences under arbitrary misspecification, even when randomization probabilities are not equal.},

This series represents only a very small fraction (,0.5\%) of the .30 000 chemicals currently marketed and used in Europe. The biomonitoring value of eels as a tool for monitoring environmental contamination is illustrated. Two major conclusions were drawn: (i) the eel is a highly suitable biomonitor for environmental contaminants, for both local and international purposes, e.g. to evaluate the chemical status for the Water Framework Directive, and (ii) dependent on the degree of pollution in their habitat, the levels of certain contaminants reported in yellow eels can be high, and might affect their potential for reproduction.},

Mercury currently causes about {$<$}1--2.5\% and 9--16\% of the restrictive advisories for the general population (GP) and sensitive population of children under 15 and women of child-bearing age (SP), respectively (the St. Lawrence River is not considered here). Toxaphene causes minor restrictions. At present it is not clear that if PCBs and dioxins/furans were to decrease below their fish consumption advisory guidelines, current fish mercury levels would replace some, most or all of the consumption restrictions. In order to examine this, location-, species- and size-specific fish consumption advisories were calculated for a ``mercury only'' scenario by disregarding the presence of the other contaminants. In the absence of other contaminants, mercury would replace some of the current advisories caused by other contaminants; however, the overall advisories would be minimally to moderately restrictive ({$<$}1--7\% for GP; 13--32\% for SP). Almost half of the Great Lake blocks considered here would have more than double the unrestricted consumption advisories than they currently have, with Lake Ontario showing the greatest improvement. Certain size ranges of each species across the main basins of the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes would be deemed safe for unrestricted consumption. However, at least some sizes of a number of species from certain locations of each lake would still have ``do not eat'' advisories issued for the SP, although these restrictions would be minimal for Lake Erie. These results suggest that the current mercury levels in the Canadian Great Lakes fish are of very minor concern for the GP and of moderate concern for the SP.},

Significant differences in fish Hg concentrations were observed across fish foraging guilds and in general, higher trophic level fish (i.e., piscivores and carnivores) showed the highest mean total Hg (THg) concentrations. However, elevated THg concentrations observed in a lower trophic level, detrivorous species highlights the importance of understanding Hg concentrations across a wide range of trophic levels, and also characterizing site-specific processes that influence methylmercury (MeHg) bioavailability. A linear mixed effects model was used to evaluate the effects of length, trophic level, sampling location, and taxonomy on THg concentrations. A positive, significant relationship between THg in fish and fish size, trophic level, and latitude of the sampling site was observed. A comparison of Hg concentrations across all sites identifies biological mercury hotspots, as well as sites with reduced Hg concentrations relative to our overall sampling population mean Hg concentration. Results from this study highlight the value of rapid assessments on the availability of methylmercury in the environment using fish as bioindicators and the need for expanded biomonitoring efforts in understudied regions of the world. This study also provides insights for the future design and implementation of large-scale Hg biomonitoring efforts intended to evaluate the effectiveness of future Hg reduction strategies instituted by the Minamata Convention on Mercury.},

The metal accumulates mainly in the kidney and the liver, with the rate of accumulation dependent on age and possibly also on gender. Collection of tissue material often results in sample selections with disparate age and gender composition, which makes comparison between different regions and different studies difficult. A previous large scale investigation of metals in kidney and liver from moose in Sweden provided Cd data (n = 3,817 and 3,802, respectively) to further explore the relation between Cd accumulation and age/gender. Based on local averages, the individual deviations were analysed with respect to the factors age and gender resulting in an `ageing function' for each gender and organ. In addition, estimates of the pure individual variations were obtained; the standard deviations correspond to a factor 1.7--1.9 for the Cd concentration, which indicates that 25--30 samples are needed to give a representative mean value (with RSD {$\approx$}10\%). In order to be able to compare results from different studies, all individual results can be transformed to represent a `standard moose' with respect to age and gender. A comparison along these lines was undertaken between Cd levels in Alaska and Sweden. Finally, a relationship between the Cd levels in kidney and liver was derived, providing at least rough estimates for kidney from liver values (or vice versa).},

Mercury (Hg) monitoring programs are valuable for generating data that can be compiled for spatially broad syntheses to identify emergent ecosystem properties that influence fish Hg bioaccumulation. Fish total Hg (THg) concentrations were evaluated across the Western United States (US) and Canada, a region defined by extreme gradients in habitat structure and water management. A database was compiled with THg concentrations in 96,310 fish that comprised 206 species from 4262 locations, and used to evaluate the spatial distribution of fish THg across the region and effects of species, foraging guilds, habitats, and ecoregions. Areas of elevated THg exposure were identified by developing a relativized estimate of fish mercury concentrations at a watershed scale that accounted for the variability associated with fish species, fish size, and site effects. THg concentrations in fish muscle ranged between 0.001 and 28.4 ({$\mu$}g/g wet weight (ww)) with a geometric mean of 0.17. Overall, 30\% of individual fish samples and 17\% of means by location exceeded the 0.30{$\mu$}g/g ww US EPA fish tissue criterion. Fish THg concentrations differed among habitat types, with riverine habitats consistently higher than lacustrine habitats. Importantly, fish THg concentrations were not correlated with sediment THg concentrations at a watershed scale, but were weakly correlated with sediment MeHg concentrations, suggesting that factors influencing MeHg production may be more important than inorganic Hg loading for determining fish MeHg exposure. There was large heterogeneity in fish THg concentrations across the landscape; THg concentrations were generally higher in semi-arid and arid regions such as the Great Basin and Desert Southwest, than in temperate forests. Results suggest that fish mercury exposure is widespread throughout Western US and Canada, and that species, habitat type, and region play an important role in influencing ecological risk of mercury in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems downstream of mercury (Hg) contaminated sites can be impacted by both localized releases as well as Hg deposited to the watershed from atmospheric transport. Identifying the source of Hg in water, sediment, and fish downstream of contaminated sites is important for determining the effectiveness of source-control remediation actions. This study uses measurements of Hg stable isotopes in soil, sediment, water, and fish to differentiate between Hg from an abandoned Hg mine from non-mine-related sources. The study site is located within the Willamette River watershed (Oregon, United States), which includes free-flowing river segments and a reservoir downstream of the mine. The concentrations of total-Hg (THg) in the reservoir fish were 4-fold higher than those further downstream ({$>$}90 km) from the mine site in free-flowing sections of the river. Mercury stable isotope fractionation analysis showed that the mine tailings ({$\delta$}202Hg: -0.36‰ {\textpm} 0.03‰) had a distinctive isotopic composition compared to background soils ({$\delta$}202Hg: -2.30‰ {\textpm} 0.25‰). Similar differences in isotopic composition were observed between stream water that flowed through the tailings (particulate bound {$\delta$}202Hg: -0.58‰; dissolved: -0.91‰) versus a background stream (particle-bound {$\delta$}202Hg: -2.36‰; dissolved: -2.09‰). Within the reservoir sediment, the Hg isotopic composition indicated that the proportion of the Hg related to mine-release increased with THg concentrations. However, in the fish samples the opposite trend was observed---the degree of mine-related Hg was lower in fish with the higher THg concentrations. While sediment concentrations clearly show the influence of the mine, the relationship in fish is more complicated due to differences in methylmercury (MeHg) formation and the foraging behavior of different fish species. The fish tissue {$\delta$}13C and {$\Delta$}199Hg values indicate that there is a higher influence of mine-sourced Hg in fish feeding in a more sediment-based food web and less so in planktonic and littoral-based food webs. Identifying the relative proportion of Hg from local contaminated site can help inform remediation decisions, especially when the relationship between total Hg concentrations and sources do not show similar covariation between abiotic and biotic media.},

  abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) continue to grow in popularity due to their ability to directly acknowledge multiple levels of dependency and model different data types. For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data.},

Here we project 2050 mercury levels in Ontario fish, using the recently measured levels and rates of changes observed during the last 15 years, and present potential implications for fish and human health. Percentage of northern Ontario waterbodies where sublethal effects of mercury on fish can occur may increase by 2050 from 60\% to {$>$}98\% for Walleye (WE), 44\% to 59--70\% for Northern Pike (NP), and 70\% to 76--92\% for Lake Trout (LT). Ontario waterbodies with unrestricted fish consumption advisories for the general population may deteriorate from 24--76\% to {$<$}1--33\% for WE, 40--95\% to 1--93\% for NP, and 39--89\% to 18--86\% for LT. Similarly, Ontario waterbodies with do not eat advisories for the sensitive population may increase from 32--84\% to 73--100\% for WE, 9--72\% to 12--100\% for NP, and 19--71\% to 24--89\% for LT.

  abstract = {otal mercury (Hg)concentration was determined in several piscivorous and nonpiscivorous species of fish from 38 drainage lakes with clear-cut, burnt, or undisturbed catchments located in the Canadian Boreal Shield. Mercury concentrations increased with increasing fish trophic position as estimated using stable isotopes of nitrogen (N; r2 = 0.52, 0.49, and 0.30 for cut, reference, and burnt lakes, respectively; p {$<$} 0.01). Mercury biomagnification per \%‰ {$\delta$}15N varied from 22 to 29\% in the three groups of lakes. Mercury availability to organisms at the base of the food chain in lakes with cut catchments was higher than that in reference lakes. In cut lakes, Hg concentrations in fish were significantly related to ratio of the clear-cut area to lake area (or lake volume; r = +0.82 and +0.74, respectively, p {$<$} 0.01). Both impact ratios were, in turn, significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon. These findings suggest that differential loading of organic matter--bound Hg to lakes can affect Hg cycling. In addition, Hg concentrations exceeded the advisory limit for human consumption (0.5 {$\mu$}g/g wet wt) from the World Health Organization in all top predatory species (northern pike, walleye, and burbot) found in cut and in two partially burnt lakes. Thus, high Hg concentrations in fish from forest-harvested and partially burnt lakes may reflect increased exposure to Hg relative to that in lakes not having these watershed disturbances.},

The relationship between concentration and length is well established for mercury, however its suitability for total-PCBs and the influence of sex over the large scale covered by most monitoring programs is not well known. Here we use what is perhaps the largest consistent sport fish contaminant dataset to evaluate the relationship between total-PCB/mercury and length and sex. We evaluated seven of the most commonly consumed fishes from the Canadian Great Lakes and two Ontario (Canada) inland lakes. For mercury, the relationship between concentration and length was significant (p{$<$}0.05) in most fish species and locations. For total-PCB, this relationship was also generally significant in Chinook salmon and lake trout, which are the species with the most advisories for this compound. In contrast, significant relationships were found less often for whitefish, northern pike, smallmouth bass, walleye, and especially yellow perch. However, mercury usually drives fish consumption advisories for these species. Overall, our results support the protocol of issuing contaminant advice on a length-specific basis in fish monitoring programs with reasonable confidence when at least a moderate number of samples over the natural size range of a species are included in the analysis. Sex differences were common for walleye (males{$>$}females, p{$<$}0.05) but not other species, suggesting that an equal number of male and female walleye should be used in deriving fish advisories for walleye.},

This battery of biomarkers was akin to those formerly applied on mussels of 3.5--4.5cm shell length for which there exist biomarker reference values in the studied geographical areas. The cause--effect relationship between biological responses and the different history of exposure to POS fuel oil was intricate for different reasons: (a) growth rate was dissimilar in mussels of the two studied localities and much lower than expected, (b) a chronological basis could not be directly associated to POS events (all mussels except the smallest from Galicia had been subjected to the direct POS impact at one or another stage of their life-cycle); and (c) some biomarkers and histopathology seemingly depended on size/age irrespectively of the locality and the POS chronology. As a whole, the present study gives a very useful set of reference values of biomarkers obtained for Mytilus galloprovincialis of different size-classes. Finally, it is recommended that Mussel Watch programmes should be designed by standardising the age of the sentinel mussels rather than their size, especially if the programme covers large or diverse geographical areas, if long-term trends are relevant or if significant pollution effects on growth are expected.},

However, fish from northern coastal rivers had up to 23-fold higher [As] when compared to fish from landlocked sites. [As] increased slightly with the proportion of pelagic carbon in a fish's diet, although relationships varied among species and sites. Furthermore, principal component scores, representing landscape and water chemistry variables, were related to [As] in fish, but these relationships varied among species. These results will help improve the efficacy of fish contaminant monitoring by further identifying key physical and ecological variables related to higher [As] in fish.},

However, the toxicity of arsenic strongly depends on which arsenic species are present. Although organic species are considered less harmful than inorganic ones, they have not been extensively studied in freshwater environments, and drivers of variation in arsenic speciation among sites and taxa remain unclear. We assessed concentrations of two organic arsenic species, arsenobetaine (AsB) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), in fish and invertebrates from three lakes near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada---a region with widespread mining impacts. Both AsB and DMA were detected in most samples (               n               \,=\,212), varying across a wide range of concentrations ({$<$}0.001--30.144 and {$<$}0.006--5.262\,mg/kg dry wt, respectively). The lake with the most severe mining impacts typically had the highest concentrations (designated by square brackets []) of AsB and DMA. In contrast, the percentage of total arsenic made up by AsB (\%AsB) and DMA (\%DMA) did not vary significantly between lakes. Arsenic speciation in fish muscle varied with fish size, selenium concentrations, and trophic elevation (inferred from nitrogen stable isotope ratios {$\delta$}               15               N), but relationships with dietary carbon source (inferred from carbon stable isotope ratios {$\delta$}               13               C) were more varied. Within all three lake food webs, [AsB] and [DMA] typically underwent biodilution, decreasing with trophic elevation (i.e., {$\delta$}               15               N). Although the aforementioned factors explained some variation in arsenic speciation, there remains considerable unexplained variation. Further studies on arsenic speciation in freshwater biota should target a wider diversity of taxa to better understand drivers of variation in arsenic speciation. In addition, research emphasizing the percentage of inorganic arsenic and other organic arsenic species is needed to improve environmental and human health risk assessments.

These properties influence the cycling of mercury (Hg), a neurotoxic and bioaccumulative metal prevalent in remote northern watersheds. In this study, we examined how 43 physical, chemical, and ecological endpoints change across 58 lake and river sites within an undisturbed boreal watershed in Ontario, Canada, and assessed the influence of these endpoints on aqueous and biotic Hg concentrations ([Hg]). We found that several physicochemical parameters, but few ecological factors, varied in systematic patterns across the watershed. Overall, [Hg] in water and some fish increased in systems with decreasing landscape positions. Aqueous and biotic [Hg] were strongly related to dissolved organic carbon and nutrient concentrations. Biotic [Hg] was lower in higher-nutrient systems, potentially due to biodilution, but higher in systems with more nitrates + nitrites, suggesting an indirect relationship between Hg and nitrogen cycling. This study is the first to assess patterns of [Hg] across an entire intact watershed and provides valuable results for a region anticipating substantial industrial development.},

  abstract = {Tabulations of numerical concentration-based environmental benchmarks are commonly used to inform decisions on managing chemical exposures. Benchmarks are usually set at levels below which there is a low likelihood of adverse effects. Given the widespread use of tables of benchmarks, it is reasonable to expect that they are adequately reliable and fit for purpose. The degree to which a derived benchmark reflects an actual effect level or statistical randomness is critically important for the reliability of a numerical benchmark value. These expectations may not be met for commonly-used benchmarks examined in this study. Computer simulations of field sampling and toxicity testing reveal that small sample size and confounding from uncontrolled factors that affect the interpretation of toxic effects contribute to uncertainties that might go unrecognized when deriving benchmarks from data sets. The simulations of field data show that it is possible to derive a benchmark even when no toxicity is present. When toxicity is explicitly included in simulations, imposed effect threshold levels could not always be accurately determined. Simulations were also used to examine the influence of mixtures of chemicals on the determination of toxicity thresholds of chemicals within the mixtures. The simulations showed that data sets that appear large and robust can contain many smaller data sets associated with specific biota or chemicals. The sub-sets of data with small sample sizes can contribute to considerable statistical uncertainty in the determination of effects thresholds and can indicate that effects are present when they are absent. The simulations also show that less toxic chemicals may appear toxic when they are present in mixtures with more toxic chemicals. Because of confounding in the assignment of toxicity to individuals chemicals within mixtures, simulations showed that derived toxicity thresholds can be less than the actual toxicity thresholds. A set of best practices is put forward to guard against the potential problems identified by this work. These include conducting an adequate process of determining and implementing Data Quality Objectives (DQOs), evaluating implications of sample size, designing appropriate sampling and evaluation programs based on this information, using an appropriate tiered evaluation strategy that considers the uncertainties, and employing a weight of evidence approach to narrow the uncertainties to manageable and identified levels. The work underscores the importance of communicating the uncertainties associated with numerical values commonly included in tables for screening and risk assessment purposes to better inform decisions.},

  abstract = {Forest management can alter the mobilization of mercury (Hg) into headwater streams and its conversion to methylmercury (MeHg), the form that bioaccumulates in and biomagnifies through food webs. As headwater streams are important sources of organic materials and nutrients to larger systems, this connectivity may also increase MeHg in downstream biota through direct or indirect effects of forestry on water quality or food web structure. In this study, we collected water, seston, food sources (biofilm, leaves, organic matter), five macroinvertebrate taxa and fish (slimy sculpin; Cottus cognata ) at 6 sites representing different stream orders (1--5) within three river basins with different total disturbances from forestry (both harvesting and silviculture). Methylmercury levels were highest in water and some food sources from the basin with moderate disturbance (greater clearcutting but less silviculture). Water, leaves, stoneflies and fish increased in MeHg or total Hg along the river continuum in the least disturbed basin, and there were some dissipative effects of forest management on these spatial patterns. Trophic level ({$\delta$} 15 N) was a significant predictor of MeHg (and total Hg in fish) within food webs across all 18 sites, and biomagnification slopes were significantly lower in the basin with moderate total disturbance but not different in the other two basins. The elevated MeHg in lower trophic levels but its reduced trophic transfer in the basin with moderate disturbance was likely due to greater inputs of sediments and of dissolved organic carbon that is more humic, as these factors are known to both increase transport of Hg to streams and its uptake in primary producers but to also decrease MeHg bioaccumulation in consumers. Overall, these results suggest that the type of disturbance from forestry affects MeHg bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in stream food webs and some longitudinal patterns along a river continuum. {$\bullet$} Forestry increases methylmercury (MeHg) in small streams but impacts along the river continuum are unclear. {$\bullet$} Elevated MeHg in basal compartments at upstream through downstream sites linked to greater \% clearcutting in one basin. {$\bullet$} This elevated basal MeHg did not increase fish Hg due to lower trophic transfer in this basin. {$\bullet$} MeHg in some compartments increased longitudinally in the basin with low forestry disturbance. {$\bullet$} Little evidence of forestry impacts on biomagnification efficiency along river continuum.},

In two First Nations communities where wild food is consumed by a large portion of the population, we compared pollutants in plasma between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, and investigated the strength of association between pollutants and insulin resistance/secretion in non-diabetic individuals.  Methods  The study population consisted of 72 participants. Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests were used to assess diabetes status. Plasma was used to determine POP concentrations and mercury concentrations were determined from hair samples.  Results  Age-adjusted plasma concentrations of some pollutants were significantly higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic individuals. When taking into account age, adiposity levels, and smoking status, POP levels were not associated with insulin resistance nor with insulin secretion in non-diabetic individuals.  Conclusions  These findings confirm that POP concentrations in plasma may be higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic individuals. No association was however seen between POP concentrations and markers of insulin resistance/secretion in non-diabetic individuals.},

In the present study, bioaccumulation and depuration patterns of inorganic Hg(II) and methylmercury (MeHg) in a herbivorous rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus were investigated at organ and subcellular levels following waterborne or dietary exposures. The results showed that the efflux rate constants of Hg(II) and MeHg were 0.104d(-1) and 0.024d(-1) , respectively, and are probably the highest rate constants recorded in fish thus far. The dietary MeHg assimilation efficiency (68\%) was much lower than those in other fish species ({$\sim$}90\%). The predominant distribution of MeHg in fish muscle was attributable to negligible elimination of MeHg from muscle ({$<$}0) and efficient elimination of MeHg from gills (0.12d(-1) ), liver (0.17d(-1) ), and intestine (0.20d(-1) ), as well as efficient transportation of MeHg from other organs into muscle. In contrast, Hg(II) was much more slowly distributed into muscle but was efficiently eliminated by the intestine (0.13d(-1) ). Subcellular distribution indicated that some specific membrane proteins in muscle were the primary binding pools for MeHg, and both metallothionein-like proteins and Hg-rich granules were the important components in eliminating both MeHg and Hg(II). Overall, the present study's results suggest that the low tissue Hg concentration in the rabbitfish was partly explained by its unique biokinetics.

Mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) contamination of fish can be toxic and limit safe human consumption, whereas selenium (Se) can potentially protect fish and consumers from the adverse effects of Hg and As. We assembled datasets of the above-mentioned elements in Canadian freshwater fish and compare them with risk assessment thresholds. We further assessed linkages between the elemental concentrations and anthropogenic activities and ecozones. Mercury concentrations exceeded the retail fish Canadian threshold (0.5 {\textmu}g/g wet weight) in 31\% of all Walleye; this proportion rose to 64\% in reservoirs. Reservoirs and lakes impacted by logging and urbanization had higher fish [Hg] than other types of impacted systems. Se and As concentrations exceeded Canadian guidelines in 5\% (aquatic life) and 0.2\% of all fish, respectively. In mining areas, fish [Hg] were low and negatively correlated with [Se], and fish [Se] were positively correlated with [As]. In all areas, we observed an important overall and previously unpublished negative relationship between mean fish [As] and [Hg], suggesting an inverse consumption risk for these two elements. The ratio Se/Hg was lower than the protective value of 1 for 14\% of all fish and was negatively correlated with fish length. However, the benefit-risk value (BRV) threshold, which accounts for the Se intake from other food products, did not suggest any fish consumption limitations, except for few very contaminated top predators ({$>$} 2 {\textmu}g/g ww). More studies need to assess the role of Se against Hg toxicity and adjust fish consumption guidelines accordingly.},

  abstract = {Consumption of fish has well-known human health benefits, though some fish may contain elevated levels of mercury (Hg) that are especially harmful to developing children. Fish length is most often the basis for establishing fishery harvest regulations that determine which fish will ultimately be consumed by humans. It is, therefore, essential to quantify the relationship between fish length and Hg accumulation in regard to harvest regulations for effective fishery and public health policy. We examined this relationship for three sportfish from six lakes across North Carolina, USA. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) had the lowest Hg levels and only the very largest fish in the most contaminated site exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Hg screening level. Black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) had an intermediate level of Hg and larger individuals exceeded the USEPA screening level; however, they tended not to exceed this level before reaching the harvest length limit. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) exceeded the USEPA screening level at sizes below the fishery length limit in two lakes, leaving only higher risk fish for anglers to harvest and consume. Removing the effects of fish age and trophic position, we found strong positive correlations between Hg and fish length for largemouth bass and black crappie. We suggest public health officials and wildlife managers collaborate to structure fishery regulations and length-based fish consumption advisories that protect consumers from Hg exposure and communicate the relative risk of fish consumption.},

Using data on tissue-mercury concentration and fish size from 30 populations of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), we show that data adjusted to a common size with bivariate regression can retain information associated with the original size differences. As an alternative, we use univariate and bivariate summary statistics from each population as raw data in a multivariate analysis to search for differences among populations. Ordination axes resulting from this analysis exhibited both small- and large-scale spatial autocorrelation. Localized spatial patterns probably reflect similar geochemical features of the watersheds of neighbouring lakes in small geographic areas. In contrast, regional spatial autocorrelation suggested broad-scale patterns that may implicate atmospheric inputs of mercury. As an extension of this multivariate approach, both regional and local patterns could be compared with environmental variables to reveal correlations that may suggest new cause-and-effect hypotheses.},

The watersheds of nine of these lakes underwent logging and nine underwent natural fires, while the 20 remaining lakes were used as references. No significant differences were found among the three lake groups in the catch per unit of effort of the most abundant species: white sucker (Catostomus commersoni), northern pike (Esox lucius), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), fallfish (Semotilus corporalis), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), and burbot (Lota lota). No significant difference was found among control, burned, and logged lakes in the back-calculated length of yellow perch, for which age determinations were made. However, we found that the proportions of small yellow perch and white sucker were significantly lower in populations of impacted lakes (burned and logged lakes pooled). The influence of logging and fires remained significant when a series of biotic and abiotic variables on watershed and lake characteristics were accounted for in multiple regression analyses. The lower proportion of small fish in impacted lakes could be due to an increase in postemergence mortality or to a shift of individuals to the pelagic zone.},

The distribution of {$\Sigma$}-chlordane-related compounds ({$\Sigma$}CHL), {$\Sigma$}CBz, mirex, and dieldrin was relatively uniform among the populations of polar bears investigated. The present 1996-2002 data of female polar bear fat samples was compared to spatial assessments of female polar bear fat samples collected between 1989 and 1993 from comparable populations. The two-point temporal comparisons showed a general decrease for age-adjusted mean concentrations of {$\Sigma$}CHL, p,p{$\prime$}-DDE, {$\Sigma$}42PCB, {$\Sigma$}MeSO2-PCB and 3-MeSO2-p,p{$\prime$}-DDE over a period of approximately 10 years. However, concentrations of dieldrin were comparatively unchanged. Comparisons of present 2001-2002 concentrations in fat of female polar bears from Western Hudson Bay showed great consistency with temporal trends (1991-1999) previously reported for the same region, i.e. the apparent non-decreasing trend of {$\Sigma$}CHL, {$\beta$}-HCH, {$\Sigma$}HCH and dieldrin, and the apparent declining trend for {$\Sigma$}PCB. However, present concentrations of {$\alpha$}-HCH and {$\Sigma$}CBz were elevated, and {$\Sigma$}DDT was notably lower in Western Hudson Bay samples compared to the last measurements in fat samples collected in 1999, which was not in accord with reported temporal trends for this region. As a result of their relatively high degree of contamination, East Greenland and Svalbard polar bears are at higher health risk of contaminant exposure among Arctic and Subarctic populations. In addition to continued biomonitoring, further research on health and population status is needed to evaluate the impact from chronic exposure of polar bear populations to CHCs and their metabolites.},

  abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and total mercury (THg) are two of the most prevalent contaminants, resulting in restrictive advisories on consuming fish from the Laurentian Great Lakes. The goal of this study is to examine the temporal trends of the two contaminants in walleye (Sander vitreus) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) for Lake Ontario. We employed Bayesian inference techniques to parameterize three different strategies of time series analysis: dynamic linear, exponential decay, and mixed-order modeling. Our analysis sheds light on the role of different covariates (length, lipid content) that can potentially hamper the detection of the actual temporal patterns of fish contaminants. Both PCBs and mercury demonstrate decreasing temporal trends in lake trout males and females. Decreasing PCB trends are evident in walleye, but the mean annual mercury levels are characterized by a ``wax and wane'' pattern, suggesting that specific fish species may not act as bio-indicators for all contaminants. This finding may be attributed to the shifts in energy trophodynamics along with the food web alterations induced from the introduction of non-native species, the intricate nature of the prey--predator interactions, the periodicities of climate factors, and the year-to-year variability of the potentially significant fluxes from atmosphere or sediments. Finally, a meaningful risk assessment exercise will be to elucidate the role of within-lake fish contaminant variability and evaluate the potential bias introduced when drawing inference from pooled datasets.},

  abstract = {We examine the spatio-temporal trends of mercury, a well-known global legacy contaminant, in eleven fish species across all of the Canadian Great Lakes. These particular fish species are selected based on their ecological, commercial, and recreational importance to the biodiversity and fishing industry of the Great Lakes. We present a two-pronged Bayesian methodological framework to rigorously assess mercury temporal trends across multiple fish species and locations. In the first part of our analysis, we develop dynamic linear models to delineate the total mercury levels and rates of change, while explicitly accounting for the covariance between fish length and mercury levels in fish tissues. We then use hierarchical modelling to evaluate the spatial variability of mercury contamination between nearshore and offshore locations, as well as to examine the hypothesis that invasive species have induced distinct shifts on fish mercury contamination trends. Our analysis suggests that the general pattern across the Great Lakes was that the elevated mercury concentrations during the 1970s had been subjected to a declining trend throughout the late 1980s/early 1990s, followed by a gradual stabilization after the late 1990s/early 2000s. The declining trend was more pronounced with top fish predators, whereas benthivorous fish species mainly underwent wax-and-wane cycles with a weaker evidence of a long-term declining trend. Historically contaminated regions, designated as Areas of Concern, and bays receiving riverine inputs are still characterized by mercury concentrations that can lead to consumption restrictions. Lake Erie displayed the lowest mercury levels across all the fish species examined. However, several species of commercial importance showed a reversing (increasing) trend in the 2000s, although their current levels do not pose any major concerns for consumption advisories. These recent trend reversals can be linked with systematic shifts in energy trophodynamics along with the food web alterations induced from the introduction of non-native species, and the potentially significant fluxes from the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Identifying waterbodies where fish methylmercury concentrations are elevated is critical for development of consumption guidelines. However, mercury concentrations vary among waterbodies and fishes due to a suite of environmental conditions and detection of elevated mercury concentrations is imperfect, resulting in inaccurate consumption guidelines. Occupancy models may be a useful approach for addressing these issues but have not been used for these purposes. Our objectives were to use occupancy modeling to (1) estimate number of samples needed to detect mercury levels surpassing {$>$}0.30mg/kg wet weight in fish at a waterbody (2) identify individual fish-level factors associated with detection probability, and (3) identify environmental-level factors linked to elevated mercury levels in fish at a waterbody. Mercury concentrations were estimated from {$>$}500 largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and walleye Sander vitreus from 30 waterbodies throughout Iowa, USA to identify individuals with concentrations {$>$} or  0.30mg/kg varied between species and increased with fish length; consequently, more samples were needed to detect elevated mercury concentrations in small versus large fish. The probability of a waterbody having fish with elevated mercury levels increased with the percent grassland and declined with percent agriculture in the watershed, providing prioritization metrics for mercury surveillance programs. Our results demonstrate that occupancy models can be a valuable tool for mercury surveillance due to their ability to estimate necessary sample sizes and identify fish sizes and waterbodies with elevated mercury concentrations while accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.},

  abstract = {The arsenic ambient water quality criterion (AWQC) for protection of human health via ingestion of aquatic organisms is currently 0.14 {$\mu$} g/L. This AWQC is derived using a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 44, which is a consumption-weighted average based on two data points for oysters and fish that was proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1980 for broad application to freshwater and marine environments. This BCF is based on the assumption that bioaccumulation is a simple linear function of the exposure concentration. In the nearly quarter of a century since this BCF was promulgated, there have been additions to the arsenic bioaccumulation database and a broader scientific understanding of bioaccumulation mechanisms and how they can be applied to estimating tissue concentrations in aquatic organisms. From this database, we identified 12 studies of arsenic bioaccumulation in freshwater fishes in order to explore differences in laboratory-generated BCFs and field-generated bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) and to assess their relationship to arsenic concentrations in water. Our analysis indicates that arsenic concentrations in tissue and arsenic BAFs may be power functions of arsenic concentration in water. A power function indicates that the highest BCF values may occur at low background levels and may decrease as environmental concentrations increase above the ambient range.},
